# transbot
A slack bot inspired in part by [a post from FullStackPython](https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/blob/master/content/posts/160604-build-first-slack-bot-python.markdown).

Designed in Python 2.7

Transbot has 3 basic purposes:
* translate source text to either German, Russian or Hindi 
* translate source text to the above language, then translate BACK to English  
* translate the source text to "Al", which is an unnatural abomination (or genius) of the English language as perpetrated by a member of our Fantasy Football group.
